## {in progress}

We are grateful (and, frankly, surprised ðŸ˜œ) you've checked our little-known yet repo. 

You can influence the future of "Seal" significantly, as it's an early-stage project. 

You joined the party ðŸŽ‰ at the right time: NO crowds yet, have NOT missed food & drinks & gifts ðŸ˜†


"Seal" needs help. 

Contributors select [Issues](https://github.com/ctrlsa/seal-app/issues) they are interested in, get full ownership/responsibility, easily track & see their direct impact. 

If NO relevant/exciting tasks in [Issues](https://github.com/ctrlsa/seal-app/issues) but want to contribute - please, text [@D_peace](https://t.me/D_peace) in Telegram or dmitry.k.sokolov@gmail.com 


Every contribution is meaningful, even tiny ones are aprreciated (Ex.: find bugs, catch typos, fix smth, write docs, add humor ðŸ˜‰, test "Seal" app manually, etc.).

However, we kindly ask to follow Seal's guidelines [...], so your efforts add more practical value. 


Every contributor may mention "Seal" project in portfolio / CV. 

Youâ€™ll also be able to brag to people around about supporting open-source ðŸ’ª ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ¤™ 


"Seal" is in the process of getting an open-source grant from one of top non-profit Foundations.

Core contributors, who deliver on the hardest tasks & deserve compensation, get the appropriate part of the grant. 

"Seal" aims to have as many core/founding contributors as possible & to get new grants.

Everyone who adds significant value can become a core/founding contributor. 

Top new contributors will get more benefits (Ex.: share of the grant) than those who started earlier but delivered less.


Other sections of this guide are "coming up ..." // Three dots instead of "soon", as let's admit: sometimes "soon" does NOT happen quickly ðŸ˜œ
