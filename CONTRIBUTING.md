We are grateful (and, frankly, surprised ðŸ˜œ) you've checked our little-known yet project. 

If you consider trying to contribute to open-source - please, check our [Issues](https://github.com/ctrlsa/seal-app/issues) 

If questions: text @D_peace in Telegram or dmitry.k.sokolov@gmail.com 

Other sections of this guide are "coming up ..." // Three dots instead of "soon", as let's admit: sometimes "soon" does NOT happen quickly ðŸ˜œ
